            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Introduction</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                With digital consumerism increasing, the UX (User Experience) and UI (User Interface) design of online retailers has a direct impact on users’ spending habits. This influence can lead to overconsumption, environmental waste, and unnecessary resource use. As a result, assessing the ethics of digital design is critical, especially in e-commerce environments.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                This essay analyses Gunpla SA, a South African online retailer for Gundam plastic model kits, to assess the ethical implications of its UX and UI design. Drawing on the concept of “dark patterns, tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to” [1], I will determine whether the design of Gunpla SA adheres to ethical standards. By evaluating its layout, marketing tactics, guidance systems, and transparency, I argue that Gunpla SA follows ethical design principles and avoids manipulative practices.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Visual Design and Homepage Layout</h3>

            <figure>
                <img src="../media/Figure1.png"/>
                <figcaption>Figure 1: The Gunpla SA home page banner</figcaption>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Gunpla SA is an online retailer specializing in plastic model kits from the Gundam franchise. Gunpla kits vary in complexity, including grades such as Entry Grade, High Grade, Master Grade, and Perfect Grade. These products are often visually striking, with flashy boxes and intricate names, which influences the visual style and layout of the site. However, I won’t be using it to judge any of the considerations.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The first eye-catching element on the homepage is a large hero banner showcasing the latest resupply of stock. This banner includes as well, a clickable image guiding users to join the Gunpla SA Discord server, encouraging users to become part of the community. Above this, the site displays social media links and a red banner advertising a special offer for a free display case with purchases over a certain amount. Notably, this promotion is not overly prominent or visually aggressive. By avoiding visual dominance, it does not fall into cognitive overload (“The amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface” [2]) or obstructive manipulation.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The community-focused Discord banner fosters a sense of trust and shared interest. Rather than pushing hard sales, this suggests that the site values its users' connection to the hobby, reinforcing ethical and user-centred design.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">User Guidance and Navigation</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Beneath the banners, the Gunpla SA logo serves as a home button. To its right, a search bar allows quick access to products. Following this is a thoughtful onboarding prompt from Miro the Meerkat, the site’s mascot, asking users if they’re new to Gunpla. Clicking the link directs users to beginner-friendly kits that don’t require tools. This is an excellent design choice that reduces cognitive load and eases users into the site’s offerings without confusion.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The navigation continues with the usual wishlist, account, and cart icons, followed by dropdown navigation links for broader site sections. The structure of these elements is intuitive and supports efficient exploration. This onboarding approach demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical design by helping users make informed choices instead of overwhelming them.  
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../media/Figure2.png"/>
                <figcaption>Figure 2: The product page</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The main content is horizontally scrollable sections of product. Firstly, new products, then in green high grade, yellow in real grade, master grade in red. The products are ordered in terms of complexity of the models which is intuitive for the users. The sections are also named after their respective grade so if a user cannot see the colour coding, they will still be able to interpret the increase in complexity.  
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../media/Figure3.png"/>
                <figcaption>Figure 3: Gunpla level explanations</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Underneath this a section with image links to the different grades of Gunpla with a little description about each grade. Above is the question, “So, What’s your Gunpla level?”. This is useful if a user scrolled through the product list and wasn’t sure what the grades meant, they can then use this section to familiarize themselves with what they may be looking for.  
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Various other products are then advertised below this, followed by a blog and event section of all the things they have catered/planned for the community including competitions. Lastly is a mission statement saying that they want to foster a community here in South Africa and to get South Africans into the annual Gunpla Builder’s World Cup (GBWC).  
            </p>

            </figure>
            
            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Marketing Tactics and Popups</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Under the banner section is another link to the Buildforce (their community project name) Discord community, along with information about GP Coin loyalty rewards, flat shipping rates, and free pickup options. These elements provide upfront clarity about logistics, helping users avoid unpleasant surprises during checkout. Highlighting that collections are free and having a visible flat-rate shipping fee before checkout supports clear and transparent communication.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Gunpla SA also employs a promotional pop-up offering a 10% discount in exchange for signing up for their newsletter. When dismissed, this pop-up appears in a small red rectangle at the bottom-left of the screen, out of the user’s main line of sight. This subtle design choice ensures it doesn’t obstruct navigation or pressure users unnecessarily. Furthermore, unsubscribing from the newsletter is extremely easy, just one link click from any email, avoiding manipulative retention tactics often seen on other retail sites.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Use of Scarcity and Bundling</h3>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="../media/Figure6.png"/>
                <figcaption>Figure 6: The purchase page for a product</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Gunpla SA uses scarcity tactics such as displaying messages like “Only 1 left in stock!” These messages are emphasized with exclamation marks, which can influence urgency. However, since the scarcity is genuine and not manufactured, it still serves a functional and honest purpose. Users are informed about real-time availability, which can assist decisionmaking rather than manipulate it.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                When viewing their cart, users are presented with a discounted bundle marketed as a “essential items.” While this bundle does include useful items, such as plastic cutters (which are genuinely essential to the building process), it also includes markers and action bases, which are not essential. Despite being framed as "essentials," these additional items are optional, and their inclusion could push users to spend more than they need to, especially beginners unfamiliar with the hobby. This mimics Amazon’s “Frequently Bought Together” feature, leveraging social proof. Though not unethical outright, this framing could be improved with clearer language about what is truly required versus what is optional.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Rewards and Community Engagement</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Gunpla SA offers a reward scheme called GP Coins. This feature is represented by a hover button with a star icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. While the icon is slightly more prominent than others like the newsletter pop-up, it does not block key information or disrupt the user journey. 
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Clicking the star opens a clear, concise menu showing how many GP Coins the user has, how they can be earned, and the discount conversion rate. This transparency ensures that the rewards system does not employ misleading or hidden conditions, avoiding common pitfalls in gamified retail experiences.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Additionally, verified users can earn GP Coins for leaving reviews with photos. Although this incentivization may affect perceived objectivity, the fact that reviews are linked to verified purchases helps maintain trustworthiness. In most cases, product pages include a long-form description and even embedded independent video reviews, further supporting ethical transparency and helping users make informed decisions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Transparency, Reviews, and Policies</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                All necessary site policies, including privacy, shipping, and returns, are accessible via the footer on every page. A link to contact the team and view the site's terms of service is also present. This ensures that users can quickly find important legal and logistical information without having to dig through unrelated content.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Transparency is further supported through detailed product descriptions. These often include images, lists of included items, and user-generated content. This helps reduce buyer confusion and builds user trust, particularly in a niche hobby where product understanding is crucial.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Environmental Considerations</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                An area worth reflecting on in terms of ethical responsibility is the environmental impact of the site. The product section allows users to filter between in-stock and out-of-stock items. However, due to the nature of the hobby and the low-volume market, the number of out-ofstock or backordered items is often significantly larger. This can lead to unnecessary image and data load, contributing to increased server usage and environmental strain. While this is not a deliberate ethical failure, it is an area that could be optimized in future updates to align with more sustainable digital practices.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Mobile Consideration</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The site scales very well and remains readable and accessible on mobile devices. This is crucial for responsive design of the web.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Gunpla SA demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical UI and UX design. The site avoids overtly deceptive tactics and instead prioritizes transparency, clarity, and community engagement. From accessible onboarding features to unobtrusive popups and honest scarcity messaging, the design encourages trust rather than manipulation. While minor improvements could be made, such as clearer labelling in product bundles and improved environmental awareness, the overall experience supports informed decision-making and user respect. In an increasingly aggressive digital retail environment, Gunpla SA stands out as a positive example of responsible and user-centred design.
