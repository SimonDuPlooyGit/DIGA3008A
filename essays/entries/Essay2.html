            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Introduction: What is outsourcing and why does it occur?</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Outsourcing is when a company pays another company to do work for them [1]. This tends to happen because a company does not have the expertise, time, or resources to handle the work. A company can also outsource because the outsourced labour can be cheaper. Often it is also used to offload and gain efficiency on the “grunt work” of the process. Outsourcing can happen domestically, other companies in the country do the work, or internationally, countries abroad do the work. In this essay, I will focus on international outsourcing. Outsourcing abroad has its place but in the current environment I argue that it is detrimental in the way and frequency that it is used. 
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="roboto-regular">The Animation Guild (TAG) and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) negotiations </h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Following the Writer’s Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) strikes in 2023-2034, TAG raised several similar concerns regarding AI automation, as well as outsourcing work [2]. Emphasis was put on the problems surrounding outsourcing and lack of local investment at a rally in August 2024 [3]. Outsourcing of American work, or overseas companies wanting to hire American animators, undermines and circumvents the unions/guilds and hence weakens their capabilities. Less union work decreases union bargaining power and say in matters. The outcome of these negotiations was positive, resulting in wage increases and AI protection, but lacked any strong outsourcing protections [4]. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">How does outsourcing affect industry? </h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                I will look at two contexts in which outsourcing, specifically internationally, is problematic in America and in Japan. In America, as stated prior, outsourcing internationally circumvents and even weakens unions and support systems set up for animators. The extreme capitalistic motivations of large American companies tend to outsource for cheaper labour costs. Avoiding unionized workers saves studios money. This additionally plays into the ideas of digital colonialism (perpetuation of colonial dynamics between the global north and south via technological and digital means), as cheaper labour is the result of exploiting workers in different countries that don’t have robust worker protection acts in place. The chain of outsourcing can also get out of hand, where outsourced companies end up outsourcing that work as well, such as work from Invincible (the animated show) ending up at SEK studio in North Korea [5]. It is also worthwhile to note, that the work that gets outsourced tends to be the hardest and most substantial bulk such as in-betweening (drawing the frames between keyframes), colouring, clean up and backgrounds.
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                In Japan it is particularly harmful as their existing domestic animation industry is already unsustainable. Young animators are heavily overworked and underpaid [6] and often must live in third party funded group homes [7]. Japan outsources a lot of work domestically already with most animation work happening on a freelance or contract basis. However, even with an already struggling domestic workforce, Japan outsources a lot of their work to South Korea [8]. This leads to an exacerbation of the domestic problem since Japan already has a lot of cheap animators. This leads to less investment in the local animation industry and hence less opportunities for improvement and growth. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Case study, Simpsons and AKOM</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The Simpsons outsources a lot of its work to a South Korean animation studio by the name of AKOM. Even though AKOM produces a lot of crucial frames and work for the series, they are typically only known as “in-betweeners” which can be seen as a demeaning term. There are examples of their work being blamed and criticized for errors that end up on the show. An example of Matt Groening stating, “The bananas were coloured wrong, I guess they don’t have bananas in Korea”, when better specificity and communication from their own prop/colour sheets could have been the problem, highlight a concerning lack of care or value that is placed on the work of these in-between workers [9]. Another example from the Simpsons is a “couch gag” from Banksy criticizing animation work in Asia as akin to slave/sweatshop labour. This segment ended up in the laps of South Korean animators who took offense to the portrayal as a gross misrepresentation of their working conditions and industry [10]. These incidents relate directly to digital coloniality and echo colonial narratives and sentiments. More menial yet crucial work is given to those deemed expendable, and then their work is simultaneously undervalued. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Threat of AI</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The imposing threat of Generative AI (GenAI), especially in the creative sector, cannot be ignored or underestimated. Since the creative space is already an undervalued space, it is easy to foresee a future where the discussed jobs and livelihoods become automated [11].
            </p>

            <p class="roboto-regular">
                GenAI has a very similar effect as outsourcing abroad on the local industry and hence poses a similar threat. AI is a major buzzword currently and is quickly becoming a very large industry, without enough regulations to manage its growth and use. GenAI also acts as an avenue for cheaper labour, replacing workers and increasing efficiency, which companies pursue for the chance at greater profits. This is also why TAG extensively negotiated about this in 2024. GenAI use will also exacerbate the already problematic space even further, leading to an even larger decrease in job security and recognition of talent, and the job market.
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Potential solutions</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                Ultimately, there need to be higher monetary incentives to hire and support locally. In terms of protection for those abroad, partnerships of unions can be considered, and support can be extended abroad. Protections and legislation regarding AI also need to improve. LuckilyTAG has managed to gain some protections and notifications promises regarding AI usage in the future. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                In conclusion, local talent and industry suffers from outsourcing abroad, since it undermines and undervalues local talent. It leads to a decrease in investment in the domestic market. Job security and the job market are affected. The pursuit of cheaper costs fuels this and leads to problematic dynamics with foreign workers/studios that perpetuate digital colonialist ideas. Potential solutions include better monetary incentives to hire locally, and to increase global collaboration between unions/guilds to protect employees across the globe.
