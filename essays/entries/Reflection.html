            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Folder structure:</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                The homepage index.html, the main.css and main.js all reside in the root folder since they are globally applicable (besides the homepage html). In this case it is easy to access these main files for any files lower in the hierarchy. Each page of the website has its own folder namely, typing test, webdesign, essays etc. With this method of separation it is easy to find the content that is relevant to that page of the website. Each folder has its own subfolders of styles, scripts and media which pertains to each page’s individually applicable CSS, JavaScript and media content. The naming structure is also consistent for all of these folders. With this structure, the work is modular and scalable, and everything is organized in terms of context. 
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Semantic markup:</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                I feel that my semantic markup is sufficient and provides enough context for my users. I’ve avoided using div’s for the most part and if they have been used they are part of a class. All of the content on the HTML files are contextualized according to the semantic markup. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Metadata:</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                I feel that the metadata that I include in the head is sufficient for the content that I have and provides the necessary information. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">CSS:</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                I have fully avoided in-line styling. Each page has its specific CSS if necessary as discussed in the folder structure section. The styling throughout the website is consistent. I am not that proud or satisfied though with the overall style of my website in terms of layout and aesthetics. The visual design and expression was tougher for me to tackle than I thought it would be. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">JavaScript:</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular">
                There is little event handling and DOM manipulation implemented in my JavaScript. There was definitely more space to implement JavaScript for navigation and other repetitive  actions. I enjoy the typing game I made and the API that I used alongside it.  A JavaScript game made more sense to me make for the section as that’s where I understand coding logic best. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="roboto-regular">Conclusion:</h3>
            <p class="roboto-regular bottom-paragraph">
                I definitely want to revisit and rework the site according to a more polished and well designed style with the current knowledge that I have right now. Knowing how to design in a robust manner from the ground up ahead of time is crucial and lead to a much smoother experience.
