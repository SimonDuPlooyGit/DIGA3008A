            My initial hand drawn wireframes for the home page were inspired by some technical artist portfolios I found
            mainly from: <a href="https://johno.re/#artwork">John O'Really</a>, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lDJVgJ">Arstation</a> 
            and <a href="https://wolfvanveen.art/">Wolf Van Veen</a>. John O'Really's website in combination with Steam profile pages inspired me to use the
            idea of a background image behing the content pages with it poking out on the sides. A consideration to the readibility of the page would be to make
            sure that the background image is not too busy that is distracts from the content page. Since tech art is a very visual thing all of these
            sites display their work front and centre which I think is the move to make. I additionally decided to add info about me as a top banner
            before the porfolio work. This is the home page because it is the easiest way to show off what you want for potential employers, which is
            my target audience. Putting all of the content in on long scrollable page on the homescreen mimics scrolling shorts/reels on social media 
            so since I am showcasing GIFs and videos this composition lends itself to this.

        <p class="roboto-regular">
            The idea is for the navigation bar to be stationary/sticky at the top of the page so the user never needs to scroll back up to the top of
            the page to get to other parts of the site. The other sections of the site can be accessed at the navbar with buttons so that a user can 
            open them in a different tab if they wanted to. To indicate that a user is on a page, the idea is for the current button to be highlighted 
            and to act like a sticky note that you would find in a book or file. 
        </p>

        <p class="roboto-regular">
            Next are some wireframes. A wireframe provides a visual plan/idea about how you want to structure your layout. You will have a nice
            blocked out reference to work from when you start building the website.

        <p class="roboto-regular">
            When you land on the home page all of the other content is at most 2 clicks away. The blogs page lists all of the blogs in chronological
            order with links to them. The same goes for the essays page. The home page and webdesign page has their content on the main page.

        <p class="roboto-regular">
            The next step would be to do some stylesheets. After this initial structure has been decided and implemented with HTML the you need to move
            onto the use of CSS. With CSS you can position things, style etc. Below is an example of some stylesheet work for a fictional company that
            was done as an exercise in class.
        </p>

        <section>
            <img src="media/StylesheetSC1.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
            <img src="media/StylesheetSC2.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
            <img src="media/StylesheetSC3.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
            <img src="media/StylesheetSC4.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
            <img src="media/StylesheetSC5.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
            <img src="media/StylesheetSC6.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
            <img src="media/StylesheetSC7.png" alt="" width="500" height="300"/>
        </section>

        <p class="roboto-regular">
            Following are some of my preliminary style sheets
        </p>

        <section>
            <img src="media/Stylesheet1.png" alt="" width="500" height="300">
            <img src="media/Stylesheet2.png" alt="" width="500" height="300">
        </section>

        <p class="roboto-regular">
            The colour palette follows the colours from the background image that I am using as a test. It is a panel from the manga BLAME!
        </p>

        <p class="roboto-regular">
            The navbar is buttons that I am planning to have act or look like sticky notes that bleed into the page and are highlighted when you are on that page. I want to make my website close to being greyscale because I like art and effects that follow that colour palette and some of my existing work and effects are a part of that. I picked the Caveat font because it looks hand drawn which follows the idea that the background and colours convey. I think the font is quite readable however on the second iteration the darker grey on the grey background is a bit less legible than the first image. The first thing in the composition that will catch the user's eye is my banner which will give them information about me which is highly important for a prospective employer to know. Next is the navbar and then the portfolio content.
        </p>

        <p class="bottom-paragraph roboto-regular">
            The first decision a user will make is when they reach the navbar and decide whether they want to stay on this page or change. In this case indicating to the user that they are at the home page and that the portfolio content that they would like to see is here, that they would then scroll down to see it. The website being a darker colour in general will allow for the portfolio content to pop out better if they are colourful. They may pop out more on the second image than the first image. When the background image goes all the way up like in the second image I think it creates a better effect and keeps the scale of the image instead of squashing it like in image 1.
