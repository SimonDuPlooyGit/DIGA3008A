                I know that for my portfolio site that potential employers will be viewing it and my goal is for them to be able to see my work easily and in an appealing manner. The homepage will have a banner with my name and some info with a sticky navbar underneath. The navbar will be sticky on all pages so that the user never has to scroll back up. Since I want to display mainly GIFs and videos I want to put them all in a single scrollable homepage similar to how social media feeds like Instagram work. None of the pages will be more than 2 clicks away from the homepage. The blogs and essays won't be contained all on one page, an ordered list will take a user to a specific blog/essay. The blogs and essays will be traversable in order on their respective pages. The web design page will follow a similar idea to the homepage and the blog/essay pages.

                Doing this exercise and planning gave me insight on a better way to structure my folders and information for my project. Following the threads/connections of how the user will move through the pages is part of setting up your files in this way. I have each page in its own folder with its own respective styles, HTML and Javascript sections. The main root level will contain site-wide Javascript and CSS.

                I am happy with my progress so far. I need to just put my design elements on and then implement some of the more semantic elements such as ARIA, Microformating and Data Attributes then I would like to move onto CSS
