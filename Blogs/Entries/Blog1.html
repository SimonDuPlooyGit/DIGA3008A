            <p>Starting with IM has already opened my eyes
                to a lot of things about the internet that 
                I was not aware of. Being born during the
                times when the internet was becoming more
                ubiquitous and not using a personal computer
                or browser until my teen years, caused this
                disconnect. In primary school for me people
                were already exposed to iPods and iPhones.
                In the Flash reading by Jay on The History
                Of The Web it's mentioned that part of the
                downfall of Flash was Apple not adopting it
                for their browser Safari. This is something
                that I can remember from when I was younger.
                I always wondered why in my computer class I
                needed to install/download these extra things
                for my browsing and found the PC ecosystem to
                be a tad more confusing. To me Flash was just a
                thing I apparently needed to have to play my
                browser games. I had no idea that it was such
                a monumental piece of software for the growth
                of the internet and that even giants like
                YouTube were built from it.</p>

                <p>I also read Turing's paper and couldn't help but think of it in a modern context. With the website "Human or Not?" you get to speak with someone for two minutes and need to decide if it's an AI bot or a person. They call it "A Social Turing Test". No doubt I think some people may not always be able to differentiate. I think this is also supported by current large language models (LLMs) that can converse with people and generative AI that can fool people. So we have reached a state where computers can complete Turing's test but I would not say that it has become popular or universal to equate any of this to a machine "thinking". We still attach a very human experience and process to thinking, just like we are doing with writing and art in the face of generative AI. It is extremely fascinating and eye opening though to see what people were thinking of or trying to predict in 1950 (except maybe the extra-sensory perception).</p>
