                In the reading, Digital inequalities in the age of artificial intelligence and big data, Christoph Lutz explores the three levels of digital divide in a more modern context. The three levels of divide being, physical access (first level), the use of this technology (second level) and then the outcomes of using this technology (third level). 
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of the first level divide Lutz mentions that studies on the first level should keep continuing a theoretical level even after internet access has increased up to 90% in some places in the world. This increase in internet access has not been a trend in countries that aren’t as rich, and economic trends mimic/are in line with this lack in access. Alongside access to the internet, not everyone has access to the same devices or quality of internet. A theoretical notion by Napoli and Obar proposes that only being able to access the internet with a mobile device is “second-class” way of access. Using a mobile device to try and do productive work is hindered by the hardware. Mobile devices are also better geared towards and perceived as tools to consume content and entertain than to work. Information that you have access to is also limited by a mobile device as not all software nor websites are made for mobile devices. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There is also a gap in access to smart devices and devices that are part of the “Internet of things” (IOT). These kinds of technologies can be useful to disadvantaged and disabled users if they could access them. Mobile devices are also closed ecosystems. Open-source technologies and developments are not as popular on mobile devices as they are on more capable devices such as laptops and desktops.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The second level divide focuses on the skills and how people use the internet. More research has moved onto this as more and more people gain access to the internet. Most of this research is related how users use the internet recreationally and not a lot for work. The results are very varied and there aren’t clear socioeconomic patterns for frequency and use case of social media however a key takeaway is age is a determining factor to predict online participation. Digital work and economies have grown largely recently and have become normalized. It is suggested that more research be done on this front to address the increase in algorithmic control that can occur and how is plays into these pre-existing digital divides. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The third level divide is the most recent topic. When considering equal access and similar use cases of the internet, the third level investigates the gap between how easily different users can use this to their benefit. The idea is that the same feedback loops and inequalities that exist socially can translate and even be exacerbated by the internet and how users use the internet. The rich get richer and influential people gain more influence etc is the idea here. The main metrics to ask about is tangible gain and benefit for a user in the offline world based on their internet use. This also relates to connecting to people, learning information etc. The second level divide, usage and skills as well as attitude determine more the benefit a user will gain rather than demographic or socio-economic factors. However, this still means that a digital divide influences this aspect of a user’s experience. More concerning is the use of big data and AI and the privacy concerns this raises. Digital traces and algorithmic biases can further social inequalities. Those who are disadvantaged are targets and more at risk for these problems.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Personally, I see effects these divides increasing soon. AI tools and their effect on how students approach course work and learning is already occurring. Existing knowledge is an important prerequisite for using these technologies well, as they are still poor at doing things correctly. Those who do not question or aren’t critical of the outputs of these technologies are robbed of learning and end up doing worse. Skills and knowledge from an existing socio-economic or digital divide hence translate into a third level divide in the use of AI. I agree that the study and focus on these digital divides remain highly important, if not more important than ever before especially with the rate at which technology advances and the online world and internet evolves. There are systemic problems and factors at the lower levels of digital divide that need to be addressed and researched.
