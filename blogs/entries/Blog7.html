                I never thought deeply about the impact of the digital image that is created of a place when it comes to how it is portrayed for example in tourism information. It’s true that your perception of a place is deeply influenced by the digital information you get from it. The study focuses specifically on Google searches, but I see it as well on forms of social media such as YouTube. Most videos on a location will tend to be videos from tourists making tourism related content. Tourism content is also typically quite dramatic and exaggerated for example with places like Japan or America. This is already a dynamic that happens with tourism. People don’t always interact with nor experience a place to the extent a local would and usually end up only doing “touristy” things, and I feel that the internet and online information exacerbates this.

                “Although they portray themselves as neutral aggregators of information, search engines have created an informational infrastructure with precise characteristics, logics, and biases” [1] This feels to me very apparent. With search engine optimization (SEO) it is difficult to maintain a neutral entity. As the paper makes clear through their study, the global north has much more local information fed to them than the global south since that is where most of the digital content and information is produced. As the paper states as well up to 12% of a user’s search results can be influenced by personal algorithms, “Although precise quantification is difficult, a study suggests that on average about 12 percent of results differ because of personalization” [1]. This to me indicates that the search engine results are not as neutral as we would like. Additionally, if a supposed neutral site such as Wikipedia is given as a resource it is not neutral either, “More recently, work has shown how user-generated digital content such as Wikipedia not just largely represents the Global North but is also overwhelmingly produced by users in the Global North” [1].
            </p>

            <p>
                It is very difficult as a user to navigate this or avoid it since Google has such a large market share in this sphere, “Google still has the lion’s share of the global search market, attracting a large majority of searches in most countries and collecting 54 percent of the global search advertising market in 188 countries” [1]. Google controls YouTube as well which is where I experience similar things and get exposed to more. “A user has a requirement for information, and the available set of published information is much larger than the user has utility for” [1], so we rely on these search engines and algorithms to give us relevant information as well. 
            </p>

            <p>
                One positive I could see from the results between figure 7 and 8 in their findings, is that almost universally the number of local links given to a user did increase once their local Googles were used to make the search. So, it seems there is an attempt to give users local links. However, Africa gained very little localness. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Their conclusion, “Google Search results shows that wealthy and well-connected countries tend to have much more locally produced content that is visible about them than poor and poorly connected countries” [1], highlights that the divide in technological and developmental advancements of a country plays heavily into this issue. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The quotes, “This gives rise to a form of digital hegemony, whereby producers in a few countries get to define what is read by others” [1] and, “This means that not only are U.S. Internet users surrounded by an extremely locally produced Internet, but U.S.-produced content is highly visible in much of the rest of the world” [1] puts into words what I think many people have felt. The US and other western media are very predominant in the online sphere. In my opinion the effects that are observed from this is the things that we see that are happening in America right now. Their extreme localness makes them an echo chamber and because that is broadcasted to us, things that happen there affects the mindsets and opinions of people all over the world, for better or for worse. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The paper also states that regardless of there being diverse search results, “The issue is rather that that diversity itself has a particular bias, and those sources tend to be almost entirely from the Global North; very few of the sources come from anywhere in the Global South” [1]. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The main takeaway was, “The presence of a strong publishing industry, using SciMago publication data as proxy, is the strongest predictor of the production of visible online content. The importance of the h-index in the model also shows that the impact of scientific publications is a better predictor of localness than the mere number of publications. Thus, we suggest that socioeconomic systems that produce high-quality research also tend to produce highly visible online content” [1]. They argue that the main factor for having more local content for a country in their Google results correlates to whether they produce valuable research. I feel however that the main content a person looks for or is shown when googling or wanting to know something about a place it is hardly ever very academic, or research related.  So having research be the potential largest factor does not make as much sense to me as perhaps other socio-economic factors such as language, digital connectivity of citizens etc does. Those factors do also play into research so perhaps they are still connected and a part of the debate in that regard.
