            <p>
                The Digital Design Widens by Tataki and Glynos as well as the The Need for Global Internet Connectivity by Daniolou readings both touch upon a very eye-opening event, that of the covid-19 pandemic. As everyone was mandated to social distance as much as possible to stop the spread of the virus public spaces were no longer accessible. The modern and most efficient way to hence keep things running is to use technology and the internet. However, this very quickly and blatantly showed that those who are not fortunate enough to be digitally connected or who own no technology were being heavily disadvantaged. Being limited to low/slow data plans and not owning a smart device was a major disadvantage as well.

            <p>
                When key activities such as attending school and going to work are compromised due to a lack of technology then it becomes evident that access to these tools are a necessity. Technology is already moving at an unsustainable pace and those disadvantaged by socio-economic factors are left in the dust. Covid-19 highlighted this, but it still happens even now and was still happening before it. Technological saviourism also highlights this divide. Not all problems can be solved or revolutionized with technology if everyone canâ€™t use or access it. As mentioned in the readings the temporary schemes to hand out data and laptops is not enough to address the problem at large.

            <p>
                This is a problem that is present on a worldwide scale, not just in developing countries. Either the speed at which technology evolves and is adopted by those who can afford it needs to lessen, or more effort and thought needs to be put into distributing these tools to as many as possible so that the divide does not continue to grow. Consumerism and marketing hype leads to a lot of these
