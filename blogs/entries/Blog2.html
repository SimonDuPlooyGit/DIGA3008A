                Reading Moulthrop was definitely an experience with tens of tabs open at a time to understand the words being used. An interesting statement to me was from Linda Hutcheon saying,
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>"the ideology of postmodernism is paradoxical, for it depends upon and draws its power from that which it contests. It is not truly radical; nor is it truly oppositional‚Äù.</blockquote>
            
            <p>
                I would not say that it does not have the capability of being radical or oppositional, but it does draw from the past. You can only move forward and onto "the next best thing" by interrogating the past, without the past there is no future. So the past is valuable for progression and maybe in a postmodern world that needs to be acknowledged more. Maybe if more value and credit is given to the past and its role in our advancement, then history may not be doomed to repeat itself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Laws of Media" from McLuhan provide a good set of questions to ask ourselves when considering this revolution on the current state of the internet. Bullet point 1 asking what hypertext enhances, brings up a matter that I think is very prevalent in today's webosphere. The idea that everything is connected, and that anyone can create and put up information, has lead to a lot of paranoia. Radicalism breeds on the internet and in echo chambers and makes misinformation easy. It's hard to find balance or see the true vision for Xanadu/truly free hypertext systems because it would be anarchy in my opinion. But I also agree that the neologism "populitism", describes what is happening with some of our news outlets and scientific research establishments, when they enforce paywalls for information. The immense amount of text and information and this sense of paranoia hurts science literacy and communication severely. But how do you differentiate from what is wrong or right, correct or incorrect in an ocean of information and text. How do you create any order. Without authority then different groups of internet users would create their own authorities and that is no different to how subreddits and online communities already work, sometimes with negative consequences. What moderation would exist in Xanadu, how do you make it so that it doesn't lead to "othering" and segragation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later it is mentioned that hypertext and hypermedia may become roadcast networks.
            </p>

            <blockquote>"as institutionalized and conservative as broadcast networks."</blockquote>

            <p>
                I think in some regards this has already occurred but it only exists in some parts on the internet. Because it is so wide there exists other sources and places to get your information and media from that are not as conservative or institutionalized. Ultimately I think we wouldn't want a revolution, or at least I wouldn't. Maybe just some more critical engagement with how things are and bringing change slowly and incrementally over time with how things evolve. I agree with the reading that the future may be more reactionary rather than revolutionary.
